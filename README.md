## Which permissions are needed and why?
1. **Modify system settings :-** To change the default ringtone of the smartphone.
2. **Read and write audio :-** To read the ringtone list and to add ringtones to it.
3. **Disable battery optimization :-** To run the app in the background.
4. **Read phone state :-** To detect incoming calls and change ringtone.
***Note :*** If you deny permissions two times, permission pop-up won't show up and you will have to manually grant the permissions.

## How the app works?
* The app makes a directory named 'Randomizer' in Ringtones folder.
* All the ringtones you add are copied there.
* Whenever the app detects an incoming call, the app fetches list of ringtones in the directory and changes the ringtone randomly.
